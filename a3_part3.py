    - The Pygame window should be 800-by-800 pixels in size
    - You should draw 100 pixels in distinct locations, *using a for loop in some way*
        - For example, a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of pixels
    - You can pick whatever colours you like for the pixels; the colours can be
      the same for all pixels, or can be different for different pixels (e.g., a gradient).
      However, the points must all be visible on the screen (so avoid white or very light colours).

    You MUST use the three Pygame helper functions in a3_helpers.py in the "Questions 1-3" section.
    You MAY use the float_to_colour helper function in a3_helpers.py found at the bottom of the file.

    Read through those functions carefully to understand how to use them in your implementation here!

    1. You may *not* call generate_point_sequence1 in this function. This is because we don't want you to
       accumulate a list of points, but instead immediately draw each point to the screen.
       This will allow you to draw a very large number of points (e.g., one million) without needing to
       store all of them in computer memory. Plus, good practice with for loop patterns!
    2. That said, your implementation should be very similar to generate_point_sequence1, and in particular use
       random.randint in the same way.
    3. Your implementation should also have the same structure as part3_warmup (particuarly the pygame parts).
    4. Like part3_warmup, you can choose any colours you want, but the points must all be visible on the screen

    - Use one or more accumulator variables to keep track of the *indexes* of the vertex points
      that have been selected so far in the sequence. (Or at a minimum, the two most recent indexes.)
    - You can elegantly avoid choosing a vertex or its neighbours by generating a *random offset*
      to add to that vertex's index.

      For example, if we have five vertices [v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4], and the current vertex is v_1,
      we can add either 2 or 3 to the index to obtain v_3 or v_4.
